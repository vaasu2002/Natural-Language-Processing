Tensorflow Hub provides a number of [modules](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding&tf-version=tf2&q=tf2) to convert sentences into embeddings such as Universal sentence ecoders, NNLM, BERT and Wikiwords.

Transfer learning makes it possible to save training resources and to achieve good model generalization even when training on a small dataset. In this project, we will demonstrate this by training with several different TF-Hub modules.
