# Co-occurrence matrix

**The co-occurrence matrix is expressed by considering the relationship between words in the corpus.**
 - A very important idea is that we think that the meaning of a word is closely related to the word next to it. This is where we can set a window (the size is generally 5 ~ 10). The size of the window below is 2, so in this window, the words that appear with rests are life, he, in, and peace. Then we use this co-occurrence relationship to generate word vectors.
