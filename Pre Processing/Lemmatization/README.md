### Lemmatization

As stemming, lemmatization do the same but the only difference is that lemmatization ensures that root word belongs to the language. Because of the use of lemmatization we will get the valid words. In NLTK(Natural language Toolkit), we use WordLemmatizer to get the lemmas of words. We also need to provide a context for the lemmatization.So, we added pos(parts-of-speech) as a parameter.
